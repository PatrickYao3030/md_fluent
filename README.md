codes for simulating the membrane distillation with using FLUENT
The membrane separation (like membrane distillation and so on) is important but unavailable in shipped FLUENT. This project is surposed to solve this with the powerful feature of UDF in FLUENT. The most important task of the project is to develop an effective method to simulate the heat and mass tranfer related to the membrane. Several previous works were done, but there are still many obstacles in a completed description of the flow, temperature and concentration fields. These will indeed hinder the intensive applications of membrane distillation.

The project is hosted by Dr. Guan @ ChE.SCUT and welcome anyone with interests to perticipate the development.
